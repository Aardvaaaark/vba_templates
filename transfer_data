    ' Use ThisWorkbook to refer to the workbook containing this code
    Dim ws1 As Worksheet
    Dim ws2 As Worksheet
    
    ' Set references to the worksheets by index
    ' Index 1 represents the first worksheet, Index 2 represents the second worksheet, and so on.
    Set ws1 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1)
    Set ws2 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(2)
    
    ' Get data from Sheet1
    Expense = ws1.Range("A2").Value
    Amount = ws1.Range("B2").Value
    ExpenseDate = ws1.Range("C2").Value
    
    ' Find the next empty row in Sheet2's column A
    Dim lastRow As Long
    lastRow = ws2.Cells(ws2.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row + 1
    
    ' Transfer data to Sheet2 without an empty line
    ws2.Cells(lastRow, 1).Value = Expense
    ws2.Cells(lastRow, 2).Value = Amount
    ws2.Cells(lastRow, 3).Value = ExpenseDate
    
    ' Clear data in Sheet1
    ws1.Range("A2:C2").ClearContents

End Sub
